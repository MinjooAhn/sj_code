# sj_project - Dialect and Foreigner Data Analysis

## Overview
This is a collection of code I wrote for data extraction and data analysis for the sj_project.
This project is divided into two main areas: Dialect Data Analysis and Foreigner Data Analysis. Each area contains specific code and tools I created to extract data from different formats and analyse them.

## Dialect Analysis

The Dialect Analysis section includes the following components:

- CSV Data Extractor: A script to extract data from CSV files.
- Data Percentage Calculator: A tool to calculate data percentages based on extracted data.
- CSV to Excel Converter: An IPython notebook that converts CSV data into an Excel datasheet.
- Other python programs that I used to move files around.

## Foreigner Analysis

The Foreigner Analysis section consists of the following components:

- Excel Data Extractor: A script to extract relevant data from Excel files.

## Foreigner Analysis

-json dataset creator: Reads the excel datafile and creates a set of json files using the set template.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3
- Pandas library
- openpyxl library 
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sj_project.git
cd sj_project
```

## Usage
All file paths have been removed so data paths must be set if needed. Also the code is not generally applicable.

## Future Changes
I should revise the code to utilise loops and exception to simplify the notebooks
